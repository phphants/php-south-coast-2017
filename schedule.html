                    On the second day, the second track of the conference will be transformed into a <em>Hands On
                    Space</em> - somewhere for people to put into practice the skills and technologies from their
                    favourite talks, collaborate with other attendees, and get some personal in-depth tutorials from the
                    experts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There'll be tables for you to sit down and get stuck in, and we'll post a timetable of who you can
                    expect to work with during each hour of the day, alongside the great talks in the main track.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slots will be available to anyone who wants to take part - perhaps you'd like to give a face-to-face
                    tutorial on your favourite framework, or show people how easy it is to contribute to your team's
                    open source project? You don't have to pick a time now, but if you're interested, please contact us
                    so we can keep you updated and answer any questions you might have.
