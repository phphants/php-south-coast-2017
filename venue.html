        <h3>Transport</h3>

        <h4>By Rail</h4>
        <p>
            If coming by train, you'll need to come to
            <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/PMH.aspx">Portsmouth Harbour</a>
            station. The dockyard entrance is about 100 yards from the train station exit.
        </p>

        <h4>By Car</h4>
        <p>
            Portsmouth Historic Dockyard is less than 5 miles from Junction 12 of the M27, follow the brown
            and white signs to "Historic Dockyard" which will lead you to the
            <a href="http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/car-parking">dockyard car park</a> on
            Admiralty Road, which has 295 spaces and is 400 yards from the dockyard entrance. If this car
            park is full, there are others nearby in
            <a href="http://www.gunwharf-quays.com/getting-here">Gunwharf Quays shopping centre</a>,
            Havant Street, Wickham Street and <a href="
                https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Portland+Bldg,+Portsmouth+PO1+3AH/@50.7986332,-1.0993563,94m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x48745d82aecefbc7:0x899ec13c3e964d40">
            St James's Street
        </a> (Small but cheap University car park, weekend only).
            You can find all the information you need about parking in Portsmouth on the <a
                href="http://en.parkopedia.co.uk/parking/portsmouth/">Parkopedia website</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>By Car with Park &amp; Ride</h4>
        <p>
            Portsmouth operates a park &amp; ride system which has services to The Hard Interchange. You
            can find more information on the Park &amp; Ride scheme
            <a href="http://parkandride.portsmouth.gov.uk/index.shtml">here</a>. Note that on Saturdays,
            the last bus <a href="http://parkandride.portsmouth.gov.uk/times.shtml#thehard">leaves at The Hard at
            19:15</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>By Air (via Southampton Airport)</h4>
        <p>
            The closest airport is <a href="http://www.southamptonairport.com/">Southampton</a> which
            serves many cities around the UK and Europe, mostly through Flybe and Ryanair. Transfer from the
            airport can be via a pre-booked airport taxi, or you can catch a train from <em>Southampton
            Airport Parkway</em> railway station to <em>Portsmouth Harbour</em> (change at
            <em>Eastleigh</em>).
        </p>

        <h4>By Air (via London Gatwick Airport)</h4>
        <p>
            Alternatively, you may find flights to <a href="http://www.gatwickairport.com/">London Gatwick
            Airport</a>, which has reasonably priced direct train links to <em>Portsmouth Harbour</em> (see
            "By Rail" for more information).
        </p>

        <h4>By Air (via London Heathrow Airport)</h4>
        <p>
            For flights landing at Heathrow, it's easiest to catch the Rail-link transfer to Woking, and then a
            train down to Portsmouth Harbour. For schedules, check out <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/">the
            Trainline.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>By Coach</h4>
        <p>
            If you're coming by coach, you'll need to find a coach that goes to The Hard Interchange (a.k.a.
            Portsmouth Harbour). The coach and bus station is just across from the dockyard entrance.
        </p>

        <h4>By Ferry</h4>
        <p>
            If you're coming over from the Isle of Wight, you need to get either the passenger or car
            ferry to the <em>Portsmouth</em> terminals. For international arrivals coming to the ferry
            terminal, you will need to arrange a way of getting from the terminal to the conference as
            the ferry terminal is on the north-west of the city.
        </p>

        <h4>By Hovercraft</h4>
        <p>

            Travel</a> website for information about a speedy trip from IoW.
