title: We're back in 2017 for TWO days!
---

That's right, in 2017 PHP South Coast conference will be running two days of talks on {{ site.confDate }}. This means there will be more opportunity for new speakers to be a part of the conference as well as more experienced speakers being present on the lineup.

On the Friday we will have two tracks all day, followed by a social event in the evening (more details to be announced). On Saturday we will have one track of talks, starting slightly later in the morning so that everyone is nice and refreshed from the night before :)

The [call for papers]({{ site.cfpUrl }}) is open and blind bird tickets are on sale now!
