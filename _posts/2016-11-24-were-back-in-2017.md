title: We're back in 2017 for TWO days!
---

That's right, PHP South Coast conference in 2017 will be running not one, but **two** days of talks on {{ site.confDate }}. This means there will be more opportunity for new speakers to be a part of the conference as well as more experienced speakers being present on the lineup.

On the Friday we will have two tracks all day, followed by a social event in the evening (more details to be announced). On Saturday we will have one track of talks, starting slightly later in the morning so that everyone is nice and refreshed from the night before :)

We're aiming to increase the bar for learning with PHP South Coast in 2017, by introducing some polyglot and PHP-adjacent talks, as well as adding some more technically advanced talks too. But to do that, we need your help! Our [call for papers]({{ site.cfpUrl }}) is open right now, and we invite you to submit your talks right away, whether you're new to speaking, a seasoned veteran speaker, or even think that the PHP community could learn something from you.

If speaking really isn't your thing, we've got you covered too. Blind bird tickets are on sale now; grab yours now - at just Â£90, they're a bargain. Just click the link in the header or on the homepage now.
