Thank you to everyone who has submitted a talk proposal for PHP South Coast 2017. We will now begin the difficult process of narrowing down the talk submissions to those we feel are best suited to the conference, aiming to have a balanced representation of both seasoned speakers and newcomers at the conference.

The end of the CFP process also corresponds with the end of the blind bird ticket sales. Early bird tickets are now available, and the schedule will be published in the next few weeks.
