    title: Long running PHP processes
    abstract: >
        PHP has outgrown being a simple Apache module, being used on the command line not just for development tools but
        also in production. Long-running PHP processes may live for hours or days consuming messages from queues or
        background jobs to execute; this talk will guide you through several years of tweaks to make them reliable and
        performant. There are many things that can go wrong when leaving a PHP process around on your servers, but it is
        possible to solve the problems of crashing, memory leaks, interruptions, lost logs, or monitoring. The goal of
        having smooth operations has to be kept in mind - scaling your servers and traffic without scaling the people
        needed to look after them.
