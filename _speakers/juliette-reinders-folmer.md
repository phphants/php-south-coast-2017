    title: Don't work for PHPCS, make PHPCS work for you
    abstract: >
        Congratulations! Your team has chosen a coding standard to use and you're well on your way to a consistent code
        style for all your projects. But... there are some extra things you'd like to check for, some rules you really
        can't be bothered with and some which sort of fit your needs, but not completely. Now what?
        
        
        Come and learn how to make the PHP Codesniffer work for you and how to streamline the PHPCS related work-flow
        along the way.
