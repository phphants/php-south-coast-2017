    title: The New Revolution
    abstract: >
        In 1969, researchers at Stanford and UCLA collaborated to transmit the first message over what would become the
        Internet. In just five decades, the repercussions of that moment have echoed through every atom of society. The
        world is evolving at a pace unprecedented in human history as we use technology to change how we think, learn,
        communicate, and even how we understand ourselves. Let’s take an inside look at how the fusion of media and
        technology is reinventing human interaction and the role that we, as engineers and technologists, must play in
        this important process.
