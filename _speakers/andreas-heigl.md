    title: How to handle ðŸ’©
    abstract: >
        You've got strange characters like "ï¿½" or "ÃƒÂ¶" display in your application? Yes, handling non-English
        characters in application code, files and databases can be a challenge, to say the least. Whether that's German
        Umlauts, Cyrillic letters, Asian Glyphs or Emojis: It's always a mess in an international application. In this
        session you will see why that is and how handling characters evolved in computing. You will also see how
        handling characters in applications and databases can be done less painfully. And don't worry when EBCDIC, BOM
        or ISO-8859-7 are Greek to you and your Unicode is a bit rusty: we'll have a look at them too!
