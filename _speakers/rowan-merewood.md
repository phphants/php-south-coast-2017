    Rowan is a Developer Advocate at Google, which means he works with partners to build real-world applications to
    prove and shape new technology. Aside from the obligatory exposure to BASIC as a child, the web has always been his
    natural home for coding. From early Perl-based guestbooks, through Python CMS integrations, onto PHP in more places
    than seems healthy, heâ€™s seen how a high performing web app is critical to success in any business.

    title: Connecting people - Identity in your platform
    abstract: >
        Passwords are bad. We all know it, but we also know you're not going to build a service that doesn't use them -
        not if you like paying the rent. However, we can do a lot better. We'll take a whirlwind tour through the
        aspects of connecting people to your service, from generating passwords, not using passwords at all, creating
        users with one tap, identity providers, automatic cross-device sign-in, and password managers. Sign-in should be
        simple.
