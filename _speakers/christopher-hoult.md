    title: Ethical Engineering
    abstract: >
        Our increasingly connected world, along with the promises of Big Data and Cloud Computing, offers us multitudes
        of opportunities to model the world and build powerful technology to improve not only the companies we work for
        but the lives of many. Yet far too often we, as engineers, focus on providing a solution to the problem at hand
        and overlook the problems that the solution itself might cause. In this talk, I examine some of the issues our
        world throws up, and asks what it takes to engineer ethically.
