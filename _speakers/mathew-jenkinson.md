    title: What developing in NodeJS has helped me become a better PHP developer
    abstract: >
        I've worked with PHP since 2004 / 2005. The first few websites I built were all PHP driven and I've been in love
        with the language ever since. However as I've used other languages (NodeJS in particular) in work projects I've
        been able to take some of the learning and experience to make me a better PHP developer. 
        
        
        This talk will highlight some of the differences between PHP and NodeJS (as well as other languages) and talk
        about why those differences are important and how you can solve PHP problems by thinking about the solution in
        an abstract form.
