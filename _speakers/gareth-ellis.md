    title: "From Hamfist to Hamcrest: more expressive tests in PHP"
    abstract: >
        Have you ever struggled to write expressive, easy-to-read test assertions in PHP? Ever written tests where you
        have to write way more lines than the actual code you're testing? If so, then Hamcrest PHP could be the answer. 
        
        
        In this talk, Iâ€™ll show you how to use Hamcrest to make your tests read more like English sentences, and how to
        leverage the power of custom matchers to make sure that you're truly asserting against what you want to.
