    title: Develop Yourself
    abstract: >
        Modern software development changes fast - frameworks are forgotten or created, patterns become anti-patterns
        and the requirements of what a web developer should be able to do rise every day. Now more than ever continuous
        learning is important. In this talk I'd like to show some ways how we can improve as developers - individually
        and together using TDD, Katas, Pair Programming and more.
