    Nils Adermann created Composer - the dependency manager for PHP - and founded Private Packagist - a package archive
    as a service - together with Jordi Boggiano. After contributing to numerous open-source projects and different
    businesses using PHP for over a decade, he learned first hand what problems PHP developers face. His projects are
    now mostly focused on improving the developer experience around PHP and providing businesses with the tools to use
    PHP more efficiently.

    title: Managing dependencies is more than running "composer update"
    abstract: >
        You've used Composer so many times now, but how deep is your understanding of your dependencies? Can you get
        yourself out of every tricky situation? This talk will cover a broad range of dependency management subjects:
        From assessing the risk, e.g. through BC breaks, introduced into your business critical code by third party
        software, all the way to hand-on tips for working with composer in the real world, e.g. what to do if
        composer.lock conflicts during a merge, when your colleagues and you modified dependencies in different ways.
