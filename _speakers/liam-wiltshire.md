    title: RegEx Is Your Friend
    abstract: >
        RegEx is scary. At least, if you ask Google, that's what you might think (257,000). And slow (441,000). In fact,
        regular expressions are neither of these, and indeed are a powerful tool in your utility belt.
        
        
        In "RegEx Is Your Friend", Liam aims to provide some real-world usable examples of how RegEx can be used in a
        way that's fast, explaining how the different parts of regular expressions work and execute to make it
        understandable for all.
        
        
        No matter if you don't know your '$' from your '^', you are not sure when to use RegEx (and when not to), or you
        just need to find a way to make your RegEx run faster, there will be useful help and tips for everyone.
