    title: Testing for people who hate testing
    abstract: >
        I love having tests. I hate writing them. It’s tedious. It’s boring. It’s hard, sometimes harder than writing
        the code. Worst of all, it doesn’t feel like it accomplishes anything. You cannot sell writing tests to
        developers who hate it or are new to the approach. Bombarding testing jargon is not gonna help. Let me show you
        how awesome tests can be written and let's deep dive into the testing approach step by step.
