    title: Don’t believe everything you learn
    abstract: |
      A minute always has 60 seconds, right? Wrong! Ok, but a country always has a capital city, right? Wrong again!
        
      Come and join us for a lighthearted talk about some of the common falsehoods that developers believe which cause issues in real, production systems. We’ll cover the classics like timezones and names, as well as some new contenders such as geography and software versions.
