    title: "Status Change: Now Using Event Sourcing"
    abstract: >
        Being flexible to changes in business process makes our jobs easier, and it helps our applications adapt to
        those changes with minimal code changes.  One of the biggest adaptions in our applications has been the addition
        of Event Sourcing to make a note of an Event that happened in the system.  With these Events, we can affect
        change immediately, or even later.  This is most helpful in our reporting interfaces.  We can build, change, and
        throw away our reports very easily.  This is much easier than our older reports being generated by large SQL
        queries. 
        
        
        Attendees will learn:
         
         - idealogical differences between status flags and events
         - triggering events in your application
         - handling events to reflect the state of your application data
         - building reports from events that are easy to change
