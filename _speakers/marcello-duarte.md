    title: Introduction to functional programming with Phunkie
    abstract: >
        Been meaning to get to grips with the whole Functional Programming fuss? This gentle introduction, packed with
        real-world code examples, will explore enough Functional Programming basics to whet your appetite and get you up
        to speed. We’ll create live coding magic using the beautiful Phunkie REPL, and will cover everything from
        function composition and pure functions, to high order functions, currying, pattern matching, and the power of
        lists – all in PHP, thanks to Phunkie!
