    title: Test-driven Laravel
    abstract: >
        How many times have you overheard, (or possibly said yourself) 
    
         * My boss would *never* allow more time for testing
         * It takes too long to write tests
         * It's too difficult to learn how to test, I wouldn't know where to begin!
    
        I'll hold my hand up - I've said most of these at one point or another. Testing can be overwhelming.
        
    
        In this talk I'll break down the concept of TDD into a an easy-to-follow set of steps and demonstrate the
        process of building an entire feature using Laravel in a test-driven approach. You'll learn how the
        implementation of your application should be shaped by the tests that are written up front. You'll implement
        the right thing more often, and improve your code - in less time than you needed without tests.
