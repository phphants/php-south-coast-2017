    title: Driving Design through Examples
    abstract: >
        Modelling by Example is a set of practices that combine BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) and DDD (Domain
        Driven Design) techniques to create a workflow that directly drives code from a starting point of user
        requirements. We will see how a simple feature can be defined via conversation with stakeholders, captured as
        automatable requirements, and expressed directly in the object model using tools such as Behat and PhpSpec.
