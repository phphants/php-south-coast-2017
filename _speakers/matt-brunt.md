    title: "Content Security Policies: Let's Break Stuff"
    abstract: >
        Content Security Policies are another tool we should have in our security toolbelt to help protect users of our
        sites. In this session I'll cover what they are, why they're needed, how they work and the limitations on what
        they can & cannot do to protect users.
        
        
        I'll demo attacks a CSP will block, break things, show what the different CSP directives & options will do and
        introduce some of the tools available to help with implementing a CSP on your sites!
