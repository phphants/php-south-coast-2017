    title: Ten practical ways to improve front-end performance
    abstract: >
        The process of improving a site’s front-end performance can be a daunting task, and it's disappointing when
        those optimizations don’t have much effect on the metrics that actually matter.  The most pragmatic (and
        rewarding) approach to web performance is one that takes advantage of all the quick, high-impact tactics that
        are available, while remaining focused on a robust, long-term performance-oriented strategy.
        
        
        This talk will present ten concrete ways you can improve web performance, split between quick tactical wins and
        longer-term overarching strategies.  With these practical tips you’ll be able to start making the changes that
        will meaningfully improve the performance, and overall user experience, of your web application.
